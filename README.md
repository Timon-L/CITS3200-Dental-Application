##Client's description
Dental Screening Mobile App

Mobile application for dental screening Poor oral health is contributing 4.5% to the total health care cost (Mainly tooth decay, gum disease and tooth loss) affects many Australian children and adults. Unfortunately, many people in Western Australia are unable to readily access oral health care services due to a combination of the vast and remote areas where they reside, a lack of available and qualified workforce, and fear of clinical dental procedures. The factors exacerbate the severity of not only dental health outcomes, but associated general health outcomes like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, lung conditions, adverse pregnancy and oral cancer in remote communities and subsequently leads to higher cost impacts for delayed treatment and procedures. The aim of this project is to build a phone application that would be suitable for remote people to use daily to improve their oral health awareness and perhaps to improve oral health problems. You will develop an app that will allow the users to do the following:

Access educational information on positive oral health example including nutrition intake information, healthy living, oral hygiene etc
Provide instant oral health rate and guidance for a full dental assessment 

You will be provided with various oral health information and app design to be included in the app. The daily information provided by users will need to be accessed by assigned people only or myself.
